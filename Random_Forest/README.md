## 🌲 Random Forest Projects – Classification & Regression

This repository demonstrates the use of **Random Forests** for solving real-world machine learning problems, including **binary classification** and **regression** tasks using Scikit-learn.

### 🧠 Algorithms Used

* `RandomForestClassifier` – an ensemble of decision trees for classification
* `RandomForestRegressor` – an ensemble of decision trees for regression

---

### 📊 Datasets Used

* 🛳️ **Titanic Dataset** (via Seaborn): Passenger data used to predict survival
* 🏠 **California Housing Dataset** (via Scikit-learn): Predict house prices from geographical and economic data

---

### 🔧 Requirements
Install required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
```

---


### 🔬 Features Demonstrated

* Handling missing and categorical data
* Feature encoding (e.g., `sex`, `embarked`)
* Random forest training and prediction
* Performance evaluation using:

  * Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (classification)
  * MSE, R² score (regression)
* Feature importance analysis

---

### 🧪 Assignments (Notebooks/Ideas)

This repo also supports:

* 📌 Predicting Employee Attrition with Random Forests
* 📌 Car Price Estimation using Kaggle's CarDekho dataset
