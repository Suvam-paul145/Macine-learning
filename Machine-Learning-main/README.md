🧠 What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. It finds the best-fit line that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.

🧪 Problem Statement
Predict house prices using the number of rooms as input.

Example:

Input: Rooms = 3

Output: Price ≈ ₹200K

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍

Pandas 📊

Scikit-learn 🤖

Matplotlib 📈

NumPy 🔢

📥 Dataset
Rooms-1 2 3 4 5 6	

Price- 100 150 200 250 280 330

You can replace this with your own dataset or load a .csv using pandas.

Evaluation metrics printed to console.

🧾 Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using:

Metric	Description
MAE	Mean Absolute Error – Average magnitude of errors
MSE	Mean Squared Error – Penalizes larger errors
RMSE	Root Mean Squared Error – Same unit as target
R² Score	Measures variance explained by the model (1 is perfect)
