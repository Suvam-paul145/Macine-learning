## ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Projects â€“ Classification & Regression

Welcome to this collection of mini-projects showcasing the power of **Decision Trees** in machine learning. This repository contains classification and regression examples using Scikit-learn.

### ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

* `DecisionTreeClassifier` â€“ for classification tasks
* `DecisionTreeRegressor` â€“ for regression problems

---

### ðŸ”§ Requirements

Install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
```

---

### ðŸ“Š Features Demonstrated

* Data preprocessing
* Train/test splitting
* Decision tree training
* Accuracy and classification metrics
* Regression error analysis
* Visualization with Seaborn/Graphviz (optional)

---

### ðŸ§ª Datasets Used

* Scikit-learn built-in: Iris, California Housing
* Public: Pima Indian Diabetes, Titanic
* Simulated: Loan Approval
